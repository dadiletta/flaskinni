# Flaskinni: Now with More Superpowers! 🦸‍♂️

### [Documentation](https://gilmour.gitbook.io/compsci/web-development)
This is your friendly neighborhood Flask starter kit, now turbocharged with Supabase. Flask remains our favorite framework because it shows you all the web development magic without hiding it behind a curtain. While other frameworks might give you everything and the kitchen sink, Flask lets you see how the plumbing works. Flaskinni just makes sure you don't have to build every pipe from scratch.

### Features
- 🚀 Flask + Supabase = Modern web stack without the complexity
- 🔒 Rock-solid authentication with Flask-Login + Supabase Auth
- 🎨 Mix-and-match traditional templates with modern Preact components
- 🐋 Development with Docker - same environment, no headaches
- 🚂 Ready for Render deployment - from zero to hero in minutes
- 📚 Extensive documentation for learning and building

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repo
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Supabase credentials
3. `docker compose up` (yes, it's that simple!)
